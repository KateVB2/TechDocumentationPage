        <p>Mental imagery, or the ability to create a visual representation of a word or sound in your mind, is an incredibly useful tool when learning to read or spell. Students with dyslexia or dysorthography can especially benefit from this strategy.</p>
        <p>The following steps must be conducted by a teacher or a parent, with the goal that students will eventually be able to use this strategy to read and spell independently.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Letters_and_Sounds">
        <header>Letters and Sounds</header>
        <p>Begin by ensuring the student has a solid understanding of the names of letters and what sounds they make.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Teacher shows a letter card to the student then takes it away.</li>
        <li>Student uses their mental imagery to picture the letter, then says the letter name and/or sound and air-writes it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Air-writing should be done in lower-case letters and should happen while the student is saying the letter name/sound.</p>
        <p class="error"><span class="iferror">If error:</span> give student correct letter name / sound / shape and repeat.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Syllables">
        <header>Syllables</header>
        <p>Once the student has a stable understanding of at least half of the letters, begin to introduce syllables.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Teacher shows syllable card to the student then takes it away.</li>
          <li>Student uses their mental imagery to picture the letters, then says the sound they make while air-writing the letters.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="error"><span class="iferror">If error:</span> respond positively to the student's attempt and question their response to help them compare it to the stimulus. E.g. If the card says 'st' and the student responds with 'sp' say: "Well done for making the 's' sound! When you say 'sp', what do you picture as the second letter? Let's see if that matches the card."</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Air-Writing">
        <header>Air-Writing</header>
        <p>When the student has a good understanding of common syllables, begin air-writing letters and sounds without card prompts.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Teacher says a word.</li>
          <li>Student repeats word and uses their mental imagery to air-write the letters that make up that word.</li>
          <li>Teacher asks "What did you see as the nth letter?" or "Can you now air-write it backwards?" or "If we swapped the l for a p, what would the word say?".</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="error"><span class="iferror">If error:</span> respond positively to the student's attempt and question their response to help them compare it to the original word. E.g. If the teacher says 'cat' and the student responds with 'c-o-t' say: "Well done it does start with a 'c' and end with a 't'! When you say 'c-o-t', what sound would that 'o' make? Does that match our word 'cat'?".</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Decoding">
        <header>Decoding</header>
        <p>The next step is to get the student to read sets of real and nonsense words from a list. Ideally 20 words at their level should be read in 5-10 minutes.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Teacher shows the student a list of words (<b>only</b> with letters and sounds that have already been introduced).</li>
          <li>Student reads the word. <br/>It can be helpful to get the student to identify the vowel sound before reading the word. <br/>When decoding words with two or more syllables, it can also be helpful to get the student to break into chunks and decode each separately before reading the word as a whole.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="error"><span class="iferror">If error:</span> respond positively to the student's attempt and question their response to help them compare it to the stimulus. E.g. If the word says 'bad' and the student says 'dad', respond with: "That 'ad' sound is great, well done, let's keep that. When you say 'dad' what do you picture as the first letter? (If error) When you say 'dad' it makes me picture the word starts with a 'd', does that match our word?".</p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Sight_Words">
        <header>Sight Words</header>
        <p>Building up a students ability to instantly recognise and read sight words is a crucial step in learning to read. Lists of sight words are available online.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Teacher shows the sight word to the student and asks what does this say.</li>
          <li>Student responds. The teacher marks the card with a tally. When the student has responded correctly five times in a row it can be assumed that they have learned this sight word.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="error"><span class="iferror">If error:</span> respond positively to the student's attempt. If the word follows typical pronunciation patterns, encourage the student to decode the word again with the methods explored above. <br/>If the word does not, e.g. 'was', the teacher reminds the student that unfortunately this word doesn't follow the rules and tells the student what is says. The student repeats the correct pronunciation. The teacher then covers the word and asks how do you spell 'was' and the student air-writes it.</p>
